# Networked-game-project
a simple networked java game that uses a server client connection to connect players to play a basic game of tic tak toe, and basic messaging between clients.

i decided to make this project out of frustration with how theorhetical my networks class is, and how basic my java classes are, and didcided to learn by teaching myself, hopefully it turns out well.
